## Spotify token refresh / swap service for ios-sdk authentication

This code can be used to provide a token refresh / swap service 
to use with the [Spotify ios-sdk](https://github.com/spotify/ios-sdk).

Copy the secret value variables from ``spotifyauth/config.py`` to ``spotifyauth/configlocal.py``
and edit them as appropriate.

This code is compatible with Python 3, and has not been tested on Python 2.
